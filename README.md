# Mental_Health_Prediction_App

This app accepts several input values from the user and predicts the level of depression , anxiety and panic attack in students on the basis of an imported dataset. It also predicts whether a student seeks any specialized treatment or not and states the generalizations drawn from the plotted graphs. 

Project Objective
I’m very passionate about AI and trying to apply the skill wherever I can. I have always wanted to work on a hands-on project that uses different domains of AI like NLP, Machine Learning, Computer Vision etc. But, at the same time I’m also passionate about advocating the importance of mental health. 
We see an ever-increasing suicidal tendency in today’s generation and that’s one of the most pressing issues. So in today's technology driven world, I tried to build an app that harnesses the power of AI to create a socially impactful and beneficial project. If AI can make the right predictions, understand the trends and figure out correlations, it can be quite instrumental in bringing down suicidal rates in teenagers significantly.   We see numerous cases of depression, anxiety, panic attack or nervous breakdowns in today's teens , and it becomes increasingly difficult to handle such cases if not given special attention. 


Project Description

   I have used Machine learning to build the app. The idea was to train a machine learning model on the basis of a given data set that consists of several pointers like Study year, CGPA, Marital Status, Course Information etc. of the students pursuing college courses. The first step was to import all the necessary Python libraries and import the collected dataset. Specific columns were converted into numerical values for convenience. After all the required manipulations were performed on the dataset, I developed the backend code of the project that trains the machine learning model and constructs decision tree classifiers separately for Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attack, and Specialized Treatment so as to display the correct output on the screen. After the backend code is complete, there is the frontend code of the project. These are the blocks of code that design a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or screen of the project. It determines how the screen with which the users interact will look like. There are 5 user interfaces in total that appear on the screen. The first UI is a blank screen with no labels. The second UI has 7 labels and their corresponding entry boxes/data fields (highlighted in blue). In the third UI, 5 prediction buttons (highlighted in pink) are added for displaying the conclusions, depression level, anxiety level, panic attack level, and predicting whether the students is seeking any specialized treatment or not. The respective values are entered in each of the seven data fields so that the app works properly. However, there is one precaution the user needs to take. He/she must ensure that the user input must be of the same data type as indicated in the project code within the function definition, otherwise the app may throw an error. After all the parameters are passed, the prediction buttons are clicked one by one to see the final output on the screen alongside. The ‘Display conclusions’ button redirects to a UI that shows the main inferences drawn from the graphs plotted. The output for depression, anxiety, panic attack and specialized treatment is seen in the form of either a ‘Yes’ or a ‘No’.

Functionality

Initially a blank user interface appears on the project screen.
Then a UI with seven labels and corresponding entry boxes(highlighted in blue) appears on the screen.
Respective parameters for each of the seven labels are passed into the entry boxes.The user input must be of the same data type as indicated in the project code inside the function definition.
There are four prediction buttons(highlighted in pink) for depression,anxiety,panic attack and specialized treatment,each of which is clicked to see the corresponding output alongside in the form of a'yes' or a 'no'.
Some of the important correlations are graphically represented.
There is also a 'Display conclusions' button which shows the primary conclusions in an easy-to-understand language for users from non-technical background.
