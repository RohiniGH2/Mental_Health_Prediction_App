# Mental_Health_Prediction_App

This app accepts several input values from the user and predicts the level of depression , anxiety and panic attack in students on the basis of an imported dataset. It also predicts whether a student seeks any specialized treatment or not and states the generalizations drawn from the plotted graphs. 

Project Objective

In the past few years,there has been an increase in suicide rates, especially among teenagers.This may be due to negative peer pressure , cyberbullying , poor academic performance etc.  We see numerous cases of depression, anxiety, panic attack or nervous breakdowns in today's teens , and it becomes increasingly difficult to handle such cases if not given special attention. So I felt, in today's technology-driven world, if I could harness the power of AI to create a socially impactful and beneficial project, it would make a difference.I have tried building an app that is accurately able to predict the depression or anxiety level etc. so as to prevent or ,to some extent, mitigate such adversities.


Project Description

A dataset is imported and the machine learning model has been trained for the prdiction of depression ,anxiety level ,panic attack level etc in teenagers.The data is trained and tested to construct decision tree classifiers for the same.The app asks for necessary data fields like CGPA,Marital Status and course information and returns output in the form of either a 'yes' or a 'no' on a user interface. Some selected graphs are shown along with quite a few important conclusions displayed in textual format on a separate screen that makes this project user-friendly and easy to understand for users who don't have any prior experience or expertise in coding.

Functionality

Initially a blank user interface appears on the project screen.
Then a UI with seven labels and corresponding entry boxes(highlighted in blue) appears on the screen.
Respective parameters for each of the seven labels are passed into the entry boxes.The user input must be of the same data type as indicated in the project code inside the function definition.
There are four prediction buttons(highlighted in pink) for depression,anxiety,panic attack and specialized treatment,each of which is clicked to see the corresponding output alongside in the form of a'yes' or a 'no'.
Some of the important correlations are graphically represented.
There is also a 'Display conclusions' button which shows the primary conclusions in an easy-to-understand language for users from non-technical background.
